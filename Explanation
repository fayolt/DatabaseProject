Reminder from Hyppo's explanation about the DBMS

IF YOU HAVE anything to change, just put a comment or edit the file (make a PULL REQUEST to change the file)

If you don't understand something just ask me or Hyppo ^^

5 pts :
	- create table,
	- insert new tuple in existing table,
	- delete row in existing table, ->
	- update values of data items, ->
	- search row or columns with some conditions; ->
3 pts : foreign key ->
2 pts : primary key

init.db : -> dbname
	  -> url
once we create db we put itt in this folder
data : 
-> db1
-> db2
-> db3

db1 : db.name.inf, db.name.tb, db.name.tdf

create database: 
3 lvl 
-interface (menu->popup->enter db name)
-create db entity object (what info need to be put)
-file on HD (I/O)

1)create db: init.db -> write db info like name plus folder path
2) create folder for db
-> db.name.inf file
3) open db 3 steps : menu-> popup-> dropdown list

dropdownlist : operation to read file and get in memory

with the name, we can look for the folder then read the files inside
4) create table : user clicks, popup then fills information
Create table object, file operation (folder of the db, write the information on the file)

Use arraylist to store information from db : what info we want to store in memory ( have to think ) -> name, location/path, list of tables (name of the table, location, time when created, last modified?)

One table contains list of attributes -> go to the file which contains attributes, put into arrayList

ex : update value -> need attribute value 

2 datastructures : arrayList, HashMap, maybe multivalueMap

hashmap 2 parameters key and value ( key string, value any datatype ) -> store values of the attributes

ex Table student : id,name,age
Insert into student (1,aubrey,50)
	    student (2,david,40) (can be stored in hashmap)


From Andrew : connect interface with code
lot of debug
